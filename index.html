                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
                <p>The primary users of this application will be college students who are nearing graduation. Of course, the web application will also be useful to anyone seeking a job who is unsure of what they want to do, but our intended audience is students who are soon in need of employment. The web application will also be useful to anyone who is interested in potentially pursuing a different path for their career. This is possible since the web application is not based on centralizing a user’s data, but more so suggesting career paths that complement the user’s past experiences/projects.</p>
                <p>The users will be utilizing information from a .csv file found on Kaggle. This data is centered on the types of jobs that Google offers, description of responsibilities, and description of qualifications. If you would like to find out more information about this dataset, you can do so <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/google-job-skills">here.</a></p>
                <p>The users will be able to engage with the web app in a multitude of ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most prominent usage will be entering their experience and/or interests and then receiving results that suggest different jobs to apply to or fields that they should explore more.</li>
                    <li>In addition to that, the client will be able to save jobs/career fields as favorites so that they can come back later and do more research on what they have found to be most useful.</li>
                    <li>Ultimately, the web app will have the ability to sort, filter, and save data based on the client's input.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This app will provide an environment where prospective job applicants can find jobs that fit their skills and interests rather than being restricted to searching for job titles. This app will empower users to find jobs that actually fit their skillset opposed to aimlessly searching for hours on end. This will save time and get users out into the workforce faster.</p>
