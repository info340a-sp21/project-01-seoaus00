        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>As two college students who are graduating this spring, we know exactly what it is like to be unsure of where we will land post-graduation. This is a problem that thousands of college students face every single year, and we wanted to design a web application that would allow college students to input their experience and interests and hopefully provide guidance for potential fields that they could go into once they graduate.</p>
        <p>Oftentimes, big companies can provide too much information in their job descriptions which can be overwhelming to prospective job applicants. The “required” skills often deter job seekers from applying to these jobs as they feel they have to check all of the boxes.</p>
        <p>The most prominent existing attempt that solves this problem is LinkedIn. There are various other job-searching web applications like Handshake, glassdoor, and Indeed; however, we wanted to create a technological solution that doesn’t just offer jobs to apply to, but also offers advice on potential career fields that may have not been on a students radar to begin with. Lots of times, people do not realize that their experience is applicable to more than one field, and we wanted to develop an application that would enlighten students and show them that there are plenty of opportunities to exercise the work that they have done.</p>
        <div class="sources">
            <p>You can find more information about LinkedIn, Handshake, and Indeed here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>The primary users of this application will be college students who are nearing graduation. Of course, the web application will also be useful to anyone seeking a job who is unsure of what they want to do, but our intended audience is students who are soon in need of employment. The web application will also be useful to anyone who is interested in potentially pursuing a different path for their career. This is possible since the web application is not based on centralizing a user’s data, but more so suggesting career paths that complement the user’s past experiences/projects.</p>
        <p>The users will be utilizing information from a .csv file found on Kaggle. This data is centered on the types of jobs that Google offers, description of responsibilities, and description of qualifications. If you would like to find out more information about this dataset, you can do so <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/google-job-skills">here.</a></p>
        <p>The users will be able to engage with the web app in a multitude of ways. The most prominent usage will be entering their experience and/or interests and then receiving results from the csv that suggest different jobs to apply to or fields that they should explore more. In addition to this, the students will be able to save jobs/career fields as favorites so that they can come back later and do more research on what they have found to be most useful. The web app will have the ability to sort the data, filter the data, and ultimately save the data for later usage.</p>
        <p>This app will provide an environment where prospective job applicants can find jobs that fit their skills and interests rather than being restricted to searching for job titles. This app will empower users to find jobs that actually fit their skillset opposed to aimlessly searching for hours on end. This will save time and get users out into the workforce faster.</p>
