        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>As two college students who are graduating this spring, we know exactly what it is like to be unsure of where we will land post-graduation. This is a problem that thousands of college students face every single year, and we wanted to design a web application that would allow college students to input their experience and interests and hopefully provide guidance for potential fields that they could go into once they graduate.</p>
        <p>Oftentimes big companies can provide too much information in their job descriptions which can be overwhelming to prospective job applicants. The “required” skills often deter job seekers from applying to these jobs as they feel they have to check all of the boxes.</p>
        <p>The most prominent existing attempt that solves this problem is LinkedIn. There are various other job-searching web applications like Handshake, glassdoor, and Indeed; however, we wanted to create a technological solution that doesn’t just offer jobs to apply to, but also offers advice on potential career fields that may have not been on a students radar to begin with. Lots of times, people do not realize that their experience is applicable to more than one field, and we wanted to develop an application that would enlighten students and show them that there are plenty of opportunities to exercise the work that they have done.</p>
